Please notice that you may need to adapt part of the codes depending on how/where you saved the files above. To make your life easier, I suggest you follow the same folder structure visible in the notebooks.

Please refer to the Appendix contained in the Report for instructions on how to map the appropriate conda environment to a specifi notebook. A detailed table indicates the notebook/s corresponding to every paragraph in the Report.
